                Tri CLUB, is a simple site where you get to explore more on triangles and how cool they are and their creation protocal. Here we will explore their possibility of existance as a result of the lengths provided.

                There are four types of triangles but we will only be learning of three for this project they are:

                <div class="equi">
                    <h3>
                        Equilateral Traingle
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        In geometry, an equilateral triangle is a triangle in which all three sides are equal. In the familiar Euclidean geometry, an equilateral triangle is also equiangular; that is, all three internal angles are also congruent to each other and are each 60Â°.
                        It is also a regular polygon, so it is also referred to as a regular triangle.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="scal">
                    <h3>
                        Scalene Traingle
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        A scalene triangle is a triangle that has three unequal sides
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="iso">
                    <h3>
                        Isoscles Traingle
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        An isosceles triangle is a triangle with (at least) two equal sides. In the figure above, the two equal sides have length and the remaining side has length . This property is equivalent to two angles of the triangle being equal. An isosceles triangle
                        therefore has both two equal sides and two equal angles.
